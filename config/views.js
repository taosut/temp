/**
 * View Engine Configuration
 * (sails.config.views)
 *
 * Server-sent views are a secure and effective way to get your app up
 * and running. Views are normally served from actions.  Below, you can
 * configure your templating language/framework of choice and configure
 * Sails' layout support.
 *
 * For details on available options for configuring server-side views, check out:
 * https://sailsjs.com/config/views
 *
 * For more background information on views and partials in Sails, check out:
 * https://sailsjs.com/docs/concepts/views

  * Extension to use for your views. When calling `res.view()` in an action, *
  * you can leave this extension off. For example, calling                   *
  * `res.view('homepage')` will (using default settings) look for a          *
  * `views/homepage.ejs` file.                                               *

  * Partials are simply top-level snippets you can leverage to reuse template *
  * for your server-side views. If you're using handlebars, you can take      *
  * advantage of Sails' built-in `partials` support.                          *

  * If `false` or empty partials will be located in the same folder as views. *
  * Otherwise, if a string is specified, it will be interpreted as the        *
  * relative path to your partial files from `views/` folder.                 *
